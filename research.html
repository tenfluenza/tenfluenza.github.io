					<p>Hello, I am a <b>Biology and Environmental Science</b> student in university. </p>

					<p>Currently, I am researching the impacts of glyphosate on microbes and microbiomes thereof, including those found in soil, earthworms, and human digestive systems. In particular, I am interested in the impacts of glyphosate-induced dysbiosis on both individual and ecosystem health over time.</p>

					<p>I code in Python and R. </p>

					<p>I am also personally interested in sustainable agriculture and technologies involved in both their maintenance and development. In particular, genetic engineering and soil health are large areas of interest. I am very invested in the future of hydroponics and other means of vertical farming.</p>

					<p>If you would like more details or would like to discuss this topic with me, kindly email me and I will reply ASAP.</p>

					<p>If you would like to view my CV, publications, or qualifications, please contact me!</p>
